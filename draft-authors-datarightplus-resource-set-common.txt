1.  Scope

   The scope of this document is intended to be limited to the shared
   resource server endpoints, and their associated authorisation
   contexts.

2.  Terminology

   This specification utilises the various terms outlined within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  Authorisation Scopes

   Technical authorisation scopes are defined between Provider and
   Initiator and permit access to resource server endpoints.  In
   addition, this specification also outlines the title and a simple
   description of the language to use to describe the data set referred
   to as Data Set Language.

   Providers and Initiators MUST utilise the prescribed authorisation
   scopes and Data Set Language when seeking Consumer authorisation.

3.1.  Overlapping Scope Optimisation

   In certain situations multiple technical scopes overlap which can
   lead to confusion by the User granting permission for the Consumer
   (which may be themselves or an entity they represent).  In order to
   alleviate this Data Cluster Language presentation MUST be collapsed
   as follows:

   +=============================+============+=======================+
